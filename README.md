This Console application is implementing a Binary class which:
1.Include operations specific to Binary representation of integers;
2.Work with 16 bits binary representations of integers and implement the following operations:
  a.Binary operators: Ones’ complement (~), twos’ complement or negator (-), Shift to the left (<<), Shift to the right (>>);
  b.Binary arithmetic operators and Logical operators: +, -, *, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= ;

All algorithms perform ONLY in binary. ( no built in functions )
